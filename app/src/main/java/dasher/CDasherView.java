/**	
 * Dasher views represent the visualisation of a Dasher model on the screen.
 * <p>
 * There are really three roles played by CDasherView: providing high
 * level drawing functions, providing a mapping between Dasher
 * co-ordinates and screen co-ordinates and providing a mapping
 * between true and effective Dasher co-ordinates (eg for eyetracking
 * mode).
 * <p>
 * This class supplies only those functions which are independent
 * of the way in which we choose to represent the Model; the specifics
 * are decided in subclasses which decide exactly how a node should
 * be rendered. At present, the only subclass is DasherViewSquare
 * which draws square boxes for each node.
 * <p>
 * Most actual drawing functions will be passed on to an implementation
 * of CDasherScreen.
